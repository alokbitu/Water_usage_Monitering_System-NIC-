calculated_flow = (((raw_MaAmps - MinMa)/ (MaxMA-MinMA)) * MaxAbs) * multiplication factor

To calculate the current flow we are using the standardize millamps formula that we are using in RTDAS project. Here the calculated_flow will comes
with the unit of m3/hr





calculated_qty = round((((calculated_flow)/60)/2),3)

1.The above formula was getting used for calculating the QTY value from the current flow. As the current flow was measuring with the units of m3/hr
  and the current QTY that needs to get add in the previous QTY needs to be get calculated in m3/min , so for that we had divided the value of
  current flow with 60.
2.again the calculated QTY was get divided by 2 because , in our ongoing data transmission process in real time the analyzer was getting the
  '#01' command 2 times within a minute, so to add only one time value we had divided it by 2
